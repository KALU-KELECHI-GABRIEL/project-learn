IK Progressively solving Programming problems

## Directions
1. I will add you to the project
2. Pull down the code in your laptop
3. Solve each of the problems in the attached pdf from simple to medium difficulty.
4. For each problem (3 above), that you wish to solve, create a new git branch,name it the problem number; example "problem-1". When you finish the problem submit a Pull request to me and I will merge it.
5. if you need a primer on Git workflows you can check: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE , Progit book (my favorite resource), read chapters 1-3 - I have uploaded it as well
